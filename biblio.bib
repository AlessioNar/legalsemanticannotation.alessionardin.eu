The detection and description of the provisions according to the established metadata scheme is an analytic intellectual activity aiming at classifying portions of a normative text into provision types and to extract their arguments. Automatic facilities supporting this intellectual activity are desirable. Particularly, in this paper, two modules able to qualify fragments of a normative text in terms of provision types and to extract their arguments are presented.},

We describe the development process of the ALIS Intellectual Property ontology from both a legal and a technical perspective. We discuss the scope and the features of this IP ontology, the lessons learned, and the problems solved. This is done by comparing our ontology (the ALIS IP ontology) with the IPRonto ontology, which too is dedicated to IP. The paper also points out the benefits of both the ALIS system in general and the ALIS IP ontology in particular. Future development of ALIS will involve expanding its ontology to also include law and trademark law. Once these three legal ontologies are in place, they will be consolidated into a single ontology that will provide the framework for a general IP ontology.",

In order to facilitate interoperation and automation, DRM systems can be enriched with domain formalisations like the Copyright Ontology.

abstract={In order to improve the management of copyright in the Internet, known as Digital Rights Management, there is the need for a shared language for copyright representation. Current approaches are based on purely syntactic solutions, i.e. a grammar that defines a rights expression language. These languages are difficult to put into practise due to the lack of explicit semantics that facilitate its implementation. Moreover, they are simple from the legal point of view because they are intended just to model the usage licenses granted by content providers to end-users. Thus, they ignore the copyright framework that lies behind and the whole value chain from creators to end-users. Our proposal is to use a semantic approach based on semantic web ontologies. We detail the development of a copyright ontology in order to put this approach into practice. It models the copyright core concepts for creation, rights and the basic kinds of actions that operate on content. Altogether, it allows building a copyright framework for the complete value chain. The set of actions operating on content are our smaller building blocks in order to cope with the complexity of copyright value chains and statements and, at the same time, guarantee a high level of interoperability and evolvability. The resulting copyright modelling framework is flexible and complete enough to model many copyright scenarios, not just those related to the economic exploitation of content. The ontology also includes moral rights, so it is possible to model this kind of situations as it is shown in the included example model for a withdrawal scenario. Finally, the ontology design and the selection of tools result in a straightforward implementation. Description Logic reasoners are used for license checking and retrieval. Rights are modelled as classes of actions, action patterns are modelled also as classes and the same is done for concrete actions. Then, to check if some right or license grants an action is reduced to check for class subsumption, which is a direct functionality of these reasoners.},

The aim of INDL is to provide technology independent descriptions of computing infrastructures, consisting of processing and storage resources and the network topology that connects these resources. INDL also provides descriptions for virtualization of resources and the services offered by resources. We build our infrastructure model upon the Network Markup Language (NML). Although INDL is a stand-alone model, it can be easily connected with the NML model. In this paper we show how INDL and NML are used as a basis for models used in three different applications: the CineGrid infrastructure, the Logical Infrastructure Composition Layer in the GEYSERS EU-FP7 project and the NOVI federation platform. Furthermore, we show the use of INDL for monitoring energy aspects of computing infrastructures and its application for workflow planning on computing infrastructures.}

The use of automated information extraction techniques could significantly reduce this bottleneck. The research question of this paper is: How to address the resource bottleneck problem of creating specialist knowledge management systems? In particular, how to semi-automate the extraction of norms and their elements to populate legal ontologies? This paper shows that the acquisition paradox can be addressed by combining state-of-the-art general-purpose NLP modules with pre- and post-processing using rules based on domain knowledge. It describes a Semantic Role Labeling based information extraction system to extract norms from legislation and represent them as structured norms in legal ontologies. The output is intended to help make laws more accessible, understandable, and searchable in legal document management systems such as Eunomos (Boella et al., 2016).",

abstract = {Semantic annotation is a crucial part of achieving the vision of the Semantic Web and has long been a research topic among various communities. The most challenging problem in reaching the Semantic Web’s real potential is the gap between a large amount of unlabeled existing/new data and the limited annotation capability available. To resolve this problem, numerous works have been carried out to increase the degree of automation of semantic annotation from manual to semi-automatic to fully automatic. The richness of these works has been well-investigated by numerous surveys focusing on different aspects of the problem. However, a comprehensive survey targeting unsupervised approaches for semantic annotation is still missing and is urgently needed. To better understand the state-of-the-art of semantic annotation in the textual domain adopting unsupervised approaches, this article investigates existing literature and presents a survey to answer three research questions: (1) To what extent can semantic annotation be performed in a fully automatic manner by using an unsupervised way? (2) What kind of unsupervised approaches for semantic annotation already exist in literature? (3) What characteristics and relationships do these approaches have?In contrast to existing surveys, this article helps the reader get an insight into the state-of-art of semantic annotation using unsupervised approaches. While examining the literature, this article also addresses the inconsistency in the terminology used in the literature to describe the various semantic annotation tools’ degree of automation and provides more consistent terminology. Based on this, a uniform summary of the degree of automation of the many semantic annotation tools that were previously investigated can now be presented.},

abstract = {In the reality of globalization, the legislation of every country needs to be followed in order to achieve a well-organized globalization process because the rule of Law is a cornerstone, a fundamental foundation of every democratic state and it should be observed and respected by all in the society. The economic and industrial globalization has increased international competition and given rise to the need for an increasingly integrated and evolving legal system but the fundamental debates over globalization of the 1990s more or less petered out, without leading to a clear consensus. So, society is still overwhelmed with an over-load of legal information while in the era of Digital Transformation, technologies such as Big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, 3D promise to have a profoundly disruptive effect on the industry, business models, governance models and on the way we interact with each other in society. However, there is not a legal information system capable of supporting the legislation of all countries in order to facilitate the above operation but there are many initiatives in order to develop legal ontologies. These legal ontologies in combination with the disruptive technologies can be help the problem of fragmented legal information across-border in order to create the Big Linked Open Legal Data.},

abstract = {Law at large underpins modern society, codifying and governing many aspects of citizens' daily lives. Oftentimes, law is subject to interpretation, debate and challenges throughout various courts and jurisdictions. But in some other areas, law leaves little room for interpretation, and essentially aims to rigorously describe a computation, a decision procedure or, simply said, an algorithm.  Unfortunately, prose remains a woefully inadequate tool for the job. The lack of formalism leaves room for ambiguities; the structure of legal statutes, with many paragraphs and sub-sections spread across multiple pages, makes it hard to compute the intended outcome of the algorithm underlying a given text; and, as with any other piece of poorly-specified critical software, the use of informal, natural language leaves corner cases unaddressed.  We introduce Catala, a new programming language that we specifically designed to allow a straightforward and systematic translation of statutory law into an executable implementation. Notably, Catala makes it natural and easy to express the general case / exceptions logic that permeates statutory law. Catala aims to bring together lawyers and programmers through a shared medium, which together they can understand, edit and evolve, bridging a gap that too often results in dramatically incorrect implementations of the law. We have implemented a compiler for Catala, and have proven the correctness of its core compilation steps using the F* proof assistant.  We evaluate Catala on several legal texts that are algorithms in disguise, notably section 121 of the US federal income tax and the byzantine French family benefits; in doing so, we uncover a bug in the official implementation of the French benefits. We observe as a consequence of the formalization process that using Catala enables rich interactions between lawyers and programmers, leading to a greater understanding of the original legislative intent, while producing a correct-by-construction executable specification reusable by the greater software ecosystem. Doing so, Catala increases trust in legal institutions, and mitigates the risk of societal damage due to incorrect implementations of the law.},

There have been numerous attempts to translate these requirements into computable representations, progressing from manual to fully-automated approaches. However, it is unclear if fully-automated translation will become reliable and interpretable enough for legal matters. We propose a LegalRuleML Editor with Transformer-based Autocompletion to facilitate a semi-automated workflow with minimal manual effort. A deep learning model generates initial translations and contextualised autocompletion options. This strategy offers experts a superior translation process, including continuous improvements approximating full automation.},

abstract="This paper describes a task of semantic labeling of document segments. The idea exploits ontology in providing a fine-grained conceptual document annotation. We describe a way of dividing a document into its constituent semantically-coherent blocks. These blocks are then used to perform conceptual tagging for efficient passage information retrieval. The proposed task interfaces other application areas such as intra-mapping of ontologies, text summarization and information extraction. The system has been evaluated on a task of conceptual tagging of documents and achieved a promising result.",
